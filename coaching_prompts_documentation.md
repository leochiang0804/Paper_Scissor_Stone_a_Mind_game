# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Coach Prompt Templates & Metrics Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation for knowledge distillation training of an AI coaching assistant for Rock-Paper-Scissors gameplay. It includes all prompt templates, metric definitions, and variable explanations needed to generate realistic training data.

## Coaching Style Instructions

### Style Instruction Options
The `{style_instruction}` variable can take two primary values:

- **"easy-to-understand and encouraging"**: For casual players who need accessible advice
- **"scientific and detailed"**: For advanced players who want technical analysis

### Examples of Style Variations:
- Easy Style: "Try mixing up your moves more! You're being too predictable."
- Scientific Style: "Your entropy score of 0.845 indicates suboptimal randomization. Consider implementing a mixed strategy closer to Nash equilibrium."

## Metric Calculation Guidelines for Data Generation

### Creating Realistic Metrics
When generating training data, ensure metrics are mathematically consistent:

#### Win Rate Calculation
```python
win_rate = human_wins / total_rounds
# Should match the actual sequence of moves and outcomes
```

#### Entropy Calculation
```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def calculate_entropy(moves):
    counts = Counter(moves)
    total = len(moves)
    entropy = 0
    for count in counts.values():
        if count > 0:
            p = count / total
            entropy -= p * math.log2(p)
    return entropy
```

#### Predictability Score
```python
def calculate_predictability(moves):
    # Based on pattern detection algorithms
    # Higher score = more predictable
    # Consider: repetitions, cycles, alternations
    # Range: 0.0 (random) to 1.0 (completely predictable)
```

#### Nash Distance
```python
def calculate_nash_distance(move_distribution):
    ideal_prob = 1/3  # 33.33% for each move
    distance = 0
    for move in ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']:
        prob = move_distribution.get(move, 0)
        distance += abs(prob - ideal_prob)
    return distance / 2  # Normalize to 0-0.5 range
```

### AI Strategy Behaviors
- **frequency_based**: AI tracks move frequencies and counters most common moves
- **markov_chain**: AI analyzes move sequences and predicts next moves
- **adaptive**: AI changes strategy based on player adaptation
- **random**: AI plays randomly

### Realistic Value Ranges
- **Entropy**: 0.5-1.4 (most players), 1.4+ (very good randomization)
- **Predictability**: 0.3-0.8 (typical range), <0.3 (excellent), >0.8 (poor)
- **Win Rate**: 20-70% (typical range against adaptive AI)
- **Decision Complexity**: 0.2-0.8 (based on move variety and timing)
- **Nash Distance**: 0.05-0.4 (closer to 0 is better)

---

## Training Data Generation Guidelines

### Sequence Generation
1. Generate realistic move sequences (15-50 rounds)
2. Implement AI counter-strategies based on patterns
3. Calculate all metrics based on actual sequence
4. Ensure temporal consistency (early vs late game metrics)

### Response Quality Standards
- **Immediate Tips**: 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions
- **Pattern Insights**: Accurate analysis of actual patterns in data
- **Strategic Advice**: Counter-strategies for detected AI behavior
- **Encouragement**: Positive reinforcement based on actual performance

### Consistency Checks
- Metrics must mathematically match the generated sequences
- Performance trends should align with calculated win rates
- Pattern descriptions should match entropy/predictability scores
- AI strategy labels should match the AI's actual behavior in the sequence

This documentation ensures that generated training data will be realistic and analytically sound for knowledge distillation training.
