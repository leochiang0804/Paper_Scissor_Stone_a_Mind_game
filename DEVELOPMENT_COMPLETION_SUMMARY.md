- **Solution**: Replaced all placeholder implementations with real metric calculations
- **Implementation**:
  - 35+ comprehensive metrics with actual pattern recognition algorithms
  - Psychological assessment calculations based on move patterns
  - Strategic evaluation with confidence scoring
- **Result**: AI Coach now provides genuine analytical insights and recommendations

#### 3. Model Accuracy Comparison Fixed âœ…
- **Problem**: Model accuracy comparison was not working properly
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive accuracy calculation system in `webapp/app.py`
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `model_predictions_history` and `model_confidence_history` tracking
  - Calculate accuracy after each move by comparing predictions to actual human moves
  - Real-time accuracy display for all 7+ models (random, frequency, markov, enhanced, decision_tree, to_win, not_to_lose, lstm)
- **Result**: Live accuracy percentages now display correctly in the web interface

#### 2. Model Performance Metrics Update Fixed âœ…
- **Problem**: Model performance metrics were static and not updating
- **Solution**: Integrated real-time model tracking with accuracy calculations
- **Implementation**:
  - Dynamic accuracy calculation comparing predictions vs actual moves
  - Model confidence tracking across all strategies
  - Real-time updates sent via AJAX to frontend
- **Result**: Performance metrics now update dynamically with each game move

#### 3. Replay System UI Triggers Added âœ…
- **Problem**: No clear mechanism to trigger replay functionality
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive replay UI controls
- **Implementation**:
  - "Save Replay" button with JavaScript handler `saveCurrentReplay()`
  - "View Replays" button for accessing saved replays
  - Integrated with existing `replay_system.py` backend
- **Result**: Users can now easily save and view game replays

#### 4. Development Status Review Completed âœ…
- **Problem**: Unclear development progress and remaining items
- **Solution**: Comprehensive review and systematic implementation of remaining features
