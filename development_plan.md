    def __init__(self):
        self.current_metrics = {
            # From existing analytics system
            'entropy_analysis': self.calculate_move_entropy(),
            'pattern_detection': self.detect_move_patterns(), 
            'ai_confidence': self.get_ai_confidence_scores(),
            'win_rate_trends': self.analyze_win_trends(),
            'strategy_adaptation': self.measure_adaptation_rate(),
            'change_point_detection': self.detect_strategy_changes(),
            
            # Enhanced psychological metrics
            'move_timing_analysis': self.analyze_response_times(),
            'pressure_indicators': self.detect_tilt_signals(),
            'learning_curve': self.model_skill_progression(),
            'meta_patterns': self.analyze_long_term_patterns()
        }
    
    def provide_context_to_llm(self, current_game_state):
        return {
            'quantitative_metrics': self.current_metrics,
            'qualitative_context': self.derive_psychological_context(),

## 2. Coach Feature Development

### Phase 1: oLLM-Based Knowledge Distillation Pipeline

**Advanced LLM Integration Strategy:**
- **Teacher Model Selection**: Use a large, powerful model (GPT-4, Claude, or Llama-2-70B) as the teacher
- **Knowledge Distillation Process**:
  ```python
  # Teacher model generates comprehensive coaching examples
  teacher_model = OpenLLM.load("llama-2-70b-chat")
  
  # Generate training data from game metrics
  for game_state in comprehensive_game_scenarios:
      metrics = {
          'player_entropy': calculate_entropy(moves),
          'pattern_strength': detect_patterns(moves),
          'ai_confidence': model_confidence_scores,
          'win_rate_trend': calculate_trend(win_history),
          'strategy_adaptation': measure_adaptation(ai_moves),
          'psychological_indicators': analyze_psychology(move_timing)
      }
      
      # Teacher generates nuanced coaching advice
      coaching_advice = teacher_model.generate(
          prompt=f"Based on these metrics {metrics}, provide expert coaching advice",
          context="You are an expert RPS coach with deep understanding of psychology and game theory"
      )
  ```

- **Student Model Architecture**:
  - Target: 50-150M parameters (DistilGPT-2, TinyLlama, or custom transformer)
  - Specialized for coaching domain with game-specific embeddings
  - Multi-modal input processing (metrics + game state + player psychology)

### Phase 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering & Context Injection

**Sophisticated Prompt Architecture:**
```python
class CoachingPromptEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_template = """
        EXPERT RPS COACH ANALYSIS
        
        Game Context:
        - Round: {round}/{total_rounds}
        - Player Psychology: {psychology_profile}
        - AI Strategy: {current_ai_strategy}
        
        Performance Metrics:
        - Entropy Score: {entropy} (randomness level)
        - Pattern Strength: {pattern_strength}
        - Adaptation Rate: {adaptation_rate}
        - Confidence: {ai_confidence}
        - Win Rate Trend: {win_trend}
        
        Recent Move Sequence: {recent_moves}
        Strategy Change Points: {change_points}
        
        Provide specific, actionable coaching advice in 2-3 sentences.
        Focus on: {coaching_focus}
        """
    
    def generate_context_aware_prompt(self, game_metrics, coaching_focus):
        # Dynamic prompt adjustment based on game state
        # Include historical context and player-specific patterns
```

**Context-Aware Coaching:**
- **Player Profiling**: Build psychological profiles based on move timing, patterns, adaptation speed
- **Dynamic Context**: Real-time game state, AI strategy changes, momentum shifts
- **Personalization**: Adapt coaching style to player skill level and learning preferences

### Phase 3: Multi-Layered Knowledge Integration

**Hybrid Intelligence Architecture:**
```python
class HybridCoachingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.distilled_llm = load_distilled_model("coaching-specialist-150M")
        self.rules_engine = ExpertSystemRules()
        self.metrics_analyzer = AdvancedMetricsProcessor()
        
    def generate_coaching_advice(self, game_state):
        # Layer 1: Expert rules for common scenarios
        rule_based_advice = self.rules_engine.analyze(game_state)
        
        # Layer 2: Advanced metrics analysis
        deep_metrics = self.metrics_analyzer.compute_advanced_features(game_state)
        
        # Layer 3: LLM for nuanced, context-aware advice
        llm_context = self.build_rich_context(game_state, deep_metrics)
        llm_advice = self.distilled_llm.generate(llm_context)
        
        # Layer 4: Confidence-weighted combination
        return self.combine_advice_sources(rule_based_advice, llm_advice, deep_metrics)
```

**Advanced Metrics Integration:**
- **Entropy Analysis**: Move randomness, predictability scoring
- **Pattern Recognition**: Multi-level pattern detection (2-gram, 3-gram, conditional patterns)
- **Psychology Modeling**: Stress indicators, confidence levels, tilt detection
- **Meta-Game Analysis**: Long-term learning curves, skill progression
- **Opponent Modeling**: AI strategy effectiveness, adaptation patterns

### Phase 4: Model Optimization & Deployment

**Aggressive Model Compression:**
```python
# Knowledge distillation with metric-aware training
class MetricAwareDistillation:
    def distill_knowledge(self, teacher_model, student_model, game_metrics_dataset):
        # Train student to match teacher's coaching quality
        # Special loss function that weights game-relevant advice higher
        
        for batch in game_metrics_dataset:
            teacher_output = teacher_model.generate(batch.context)
            student_output = student_model.generate(batch.context)
            
            # Custom loss: accuracy + coaching_relevance + metrics_alignment
            loss = coaching_quality_loss(teacher_output, student_output, batch.metrics)
            
        # Post-training optimizations
        quantized_model = quantize_int8(student_model)
        pruned_model = prune_weights(quantized_model, sparsity=0.3)
        return optimized_model
```

**Deployment Optimizations:**
- **ONNX Runtime**: Optimized inference engine
- **Model Caching**: Intelligent response caching based on game state similarity
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch inference for multiple coaching requests
- **Edge Deployment**: On-device inference for ultra-low latency

### Phase 5: Continuous Learning & Improvement

**Feedback Loop Integration:**
```python
class AdaptiveCoachingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feedback_collector = CoachingFeedbackCollector()
        self.model_updater = OnlineLearningModule()
        
    def process_coaching_feedback(self, advice_given, player_response, outcome):
        # Track coaching effectiveness
        effectiveness_score = self.measure_coaching_impact(
            advice_given, player_response, outcome
        )
        
        # Update model weights based on real-world effectiveness
        self.model_updater.update_from_feedback(
            advice_given, effectiveness_score
        )
        
        # Refine prompt engineering based on successful patterns
        self.update_prompt_templates(advice_given, effectiveness_score)
```



High-Level Overview

The goals are:

Develop a Coach Feature:

Use a lightweight, task-specific LLM (~150Mâ€“300M parameters) optimized for real-time coaching during gameplay.
Ensure the model is downsized (knowledge distillation, quantization) to fit within the resource constraints of the application.
Develop an Advanced Play Mode with Wild Function Cards:

Add dynamic, disruptive mechanics to enhance unpredictability and player engagement.
Ensure seamless integration with the existing AI strategies and game logic.
2. Coach Feature Development

Phase 1: Planning

Define the coaching systemâ€™s scope:
Real-time actionable insights (e.g., tips on player moves, AI strategy awareness).
Seamless integration with Advanced Analytics Dashboard and existing ML pipelines.
Finalize the LLM:
Select a lightweight, fine-tuned model (e.g., DistilGPT-2, TinyBERT, or GPT-Neo).
Ensure the model is downsized:
Knowledge Distillation: Use the large teacher model to train a smaller student model (150Mâ€“300M parameters).
Quantization: Convert the student model to INT8 to reduce runtime memory usage (~100MBâ€“200MB RAM).
Phase 2: Backend Development

LLM Integration:

Train the distilled student model for gameplay-specific tasks:
Use a curated dataset of game logs, strategy patterns, and coaching examples.
Fine-tune the model using oLLM or frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers.
Quantize the model to INT8 using ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for optimal performance.
Example integration:
from ollm import OpenLLM
model = OpenLLM.load("distil-gpt2", quantized=True)

game_state = {"player_moves": ["rock", "scissors"], "ai_strategy": "Markov"}
coaching_tip = model.generate(f"Suggest coaching advice for this game state: {game_state}")
Real-Time Coaching Pipeline:

Extend the coach_tips.py module:
Analyze game state (e.g., player patterns, AI predictions, strategy shifts).
Generate coaching insights using:
Predefined templates for common scenarios (e.g., repetitive moves).
LLM outputs for nuanced, context-aware advice.
Caching and Optimization:

Cache frequent coaching outputs (e.g., common scenarios) to minimize LLM calls.
Use batch inference for efficiency during high gameplay activity.
Phase 3: Frontend Integration

Coach Panel UI:

Add a panel to the Advanced Analytics Dashboard to display dynamic coaching tips.
Visualize metrics like:
Move Frequency Chart: Highlight player tendencies.
Entropy Analysis: Indicate predictability of player moves.
Use visual alerts for high-priority tips (e.g., "AI strategy change detected!").
Optional Enhancements:

Add text-to-speech (TTS) for audible coaching tips.
Allow players to toggle coaching depth (basic vs. advanced tips).
Phase 4: Testing and Optimization

Validate the accuracy and relevance of coaching tips in real gameplay scenarios.
Optimize the pipeline for low-latency performance:
Ensure inference time <100ms for smooth gameplay.
Phase 5: Deployment

Deploy the Coach Feature:
Host the LLM on lightweight cloud servers (e.g., AWS EC2 T2) or integrate locally for on-device inference.
Monitor feature performance and gather user feedback.
3. Advanced Play Mode with Wild Function Cards

Phase 1: Design and Mechanics

Define the Wild Function Cards:
Card Types:
Probability Disruptor: Randomizes AI predictions for one round.
Strategy Shuffler: Forces the AI to switch strategies mid-game.
Blind Spot Card: Makes the AI ignore certain player moves temporarily.
Impact Levels:
Low Impact: Minor disruptions (e.g., randomizing predictions slightly).
Medium Impact: Moderate disruptions (e.g., switching to a suboptimal strategy).
High Impact: Major disruptions (e.g., forcing fully random predictions).
Phase 2: Backend Implementation

Card Logic:

Extend the strategy.py module to implement Wild Card effects:
Example: Probability Disruptor
if active_card == "probability_disruptor":
    ai_prediction = random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
Add cooldown mechanics to limit card usage per game.
AI Adaptation:

Allow the AI to adapt to Wild Cards over time:
Gradually reduce the impact of cards as the game progresses.
Introduce "resistance" mechanics where the AI learns from disruptions.
Phase 3: Frontend Integration

UI for Wild Function Cards:
Add a card selection panel to the gameplay interface.
Display available cards with descriptions and activation buttons.
Visual Effects:
Add animations for card activations (e.g., screen shake, glowing AI predictions).
Phase 4: Testing and Balancing

Test the Wild Card mechanics with players:
Ensure cards add fun and unpredictability without breaking game balance.
Adjust cooldowns, usage limits, and impact levels based on feedback.
Phase 5: Deployment

Release the Advanced Play Mode as an optional feature:
Allow players to enable/disable Wild Cards in the game settings.
Monitor usage and feedback for future enhancements.
4. Integration with Existing Features

Advanced Analytics:
Coach Feature will leverage existing analytics (e.g., entropy calculations, predictability scoring) for deeper insights.
AI Strategies:
The Wild Function Cards will interact dynamically with the existing AI strategies (Random, Markov, LSTM, etc.).
UI/UX:
Both features will integrate seamlessly into the web app, enhancing the overall experience.

  - Real-time actionable insights (e.g., tips on player moves, AI strategy awareness).
  - Seamless integration with **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** and existing ML pipelines.
- Finalize the LLM:
  - Select a lightweight, fine-tuned model (e.g., **DistilGPT-2**, **TinyBERT**, or GPT-Neo).
  - Ensure the model is downsized:
    - **Knowledge Distillation**: Use the large teacher model to train a smaller student model (150Mâ€“300M parameters).
    - **Quantization**: Convert the student model to INT8 to reduce runtime memory usage (~100MBâ€“200MB RAM).

### Phase 2: Backend Development
1. **LLM Integration**:
   - Train the distilled student model for gameplay-specific tasks:
     - Use a curated dataset of game logs, strategy patterns, and coaching examples.
     - Fine-tune the model using **oLLM** or frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers.
   - Quantize the model to **INT8** using ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for optimal performance.
   - Example integration:
     ```python
     from ollm import OpenLLM
     model = OpenLLM.load("distil-gpt2", quantized=True)

     game_state = {"player_moves": ["rock", "scissors"], "ai_strategy": "Markov"}
     coaching_tip = model.generate(f"Suggest coaching advice for this game state: {game_state}")
     ```

2. **Real-Time Coaching Pipeline**:
   - Extend the **`coach_tips.py`** module:
     - Analyze game state (e.g., player patterns, AI predictions, strategy shifts).
     - Generate coaching insights using:
       - Predefined templates for common scenarios (e.g., repetitive moves).
       - LLM outputs for nuanced, context-aware advice.

3. **Caching and Optimization**:
   - Cache frequent coaching outputs (e.g., common scenarios) to minimize LLM calls.
   - Use batch inference for efficiency during high gameplay activity.

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
1. **Coach Panel UI**:
   - Add a panel to the **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** to display dynamic coaching tips.
   - Visualize metrics like:
     - **Move Frequency Chart**: Highlight player tendencies.
     - **Entropy Analysis**: Indicate predictability of player moves.
   - Use visual alerts for high-priority tips (e.g., "AI strategy change detected!").

2. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add **text-to-speech (TTS)** for audible coaching tips.
   - Allow players to toggle coaching depth (basic vs. advanced tips).

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
- Validate the accuracy and relevance of coaching tips in real gameplay scenarios.
- Optimize the pipeline for low-latency performance:
  - Ensure inference time <100ms for smooth gameplay.

### Phase 5: Deployment
- Deploy the Coach Feature:
  - Host the LLM on lightweight cloud servers (e.g., AWS EC2 T2) or integrate locally for on-device inference.
  - Monitor feature performance and gather user feedback.

## 3. Advanced Play Mode with Wild Function Cards

### Phase 1: Design and Mechanics
- Define the Wild Function Cards:
  - **Card Types**:
    1. **Probability Disruptor**: Randomizes AI predictions for one round.
    2. **Strategy Shuffler**: Forces the AI to switch strategies mid-game.
    3. **Blind Spot Card**: Makes the AI ignore certain player moves temporarily.
  - **Impact Levels**:
    - **Low Impact**: Minor disruptions (e.g., randomizing predictions slightly).
    - **Medium Impact**: Moderate disruptions (e.g., switching to a suboptimal strategy).
    - **High Impact**: Major disruptions (e.g., forcing fully random predictions).

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
1. **Card Logic**:
   - Extend the **`strategy.py`** module to implement Wild Card effects:
     - **Example**: Probability Disruptor
       ```python
       if active_card == "probability_disruptor":
           ai_prediction = random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
       ```
   - Add cooldown mechanics to limit card usage per game.

2. **AI Adaptation**:
   - Allow the AI to adapt to Wild Cards over time:
     - Gradually reduce the impact of cards as the game progresses.
     - Introduce "resistance" mechanics where the AI learns from disruptions.

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
1. **UI for Wild Function Cards**:
   - Add a card selection panel to the gameplay interface.
   - Display available cards with descriptions and activation buttons.
2. **Visual Effects**:
   - Add animations for card activations (e.g., screen shake, glowing AI predictions).

### Phase 4: Testing and Balancing
- Test the Wild Card mechanics with players:
  - Ensure cards add fun and unpredictability without breaking game balance.
  - Adjust cooldowns, usage limits, and impact levels based on feedback.

### Phase 5: Deployment
- Release the Advanced Play Mode as an optional feature:
  - Allow players to enable/disable Wild Cards in the game settings.
  - Monitor usage and feedback for future enhancements.
