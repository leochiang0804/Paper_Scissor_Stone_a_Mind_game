*Last Updated: Phase 4 Complete - Visual & Character System Implementation, Character System Sub-Project Plan Added*



High-Level Overview

The goals are:

Develop a Coach Feature:

Use a lightweight, task-specific LLM (~150M–300M parameters) optimized for real-time coaching during gameplay.
Ensure the model is downsized (knowledge distillation, quantization) to fit within the resource constraints of the application.
Develop an Advanced Play Mode with Wild Function Cards:

Add dynamic, disruptive mechanics to enhance unpredictability and player engagement.
Ensure seamless integration with the existing AI strategies and game logic.
2. Coach Feature Development

Phase 1: Planning

Define the coaching system’s scope:
Real-time actionable insights (e.g., tips on player moves, AI strategy awareness).
Seamless integration with Advanced Analytics Dashboard and existing ML pipelines.
Finalize the LLM:
Select a lightweight, fine-tuned model (e.g., DistilGPT-2, TinyBERT, or GPT-Neo).
Ensure the model is downsized:
Knowledge Distillation: Use the large teacher model to train a smaller student model (150M–300M parameters).
Quantization: Convert the student model to INT8 to reduce runtime memory usage (~100MB–200MB RAM).
Phase 2: Backend Development

LLM Integration:

Train the distilled student model for gameplay-specific tasks:
Use a curated dataset of game logs, strategy patterns, and coaching examples.
Fine-tune the model using oLLM or frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers.
Quantize the model to INT8 using ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for optimal performance.
Example integration:
from ollm import OpenLLM
model = OpenLLM.load("distil-gpt2", quantized=True)

game_state = {"player_moves": ["rock", "scissors"], "ai_strategy": "Markov"}
coaching_tip = model.generate(f"Suggest coaching advice for this game state: {game_state}")
Real-Time Coaching Pipeline:

Extend the coach_tips.py module:
Analyze game state (e.g., player patterns, AI predictions, strategy shifts).
Generate coaching insights using:
Predefined templates for common scenarios (e.g., repetitive moves).
LLM outputs for nuanced, context-aware advice.
Caching and Optimization:

Cache frequent coaching outputs (e.g., common scenarios) to minimize LLM calls.
Use batch inference for efficiency during high gameplay activity.
Phase 3: Frontend Integration

Coach Panel UI:

Add a panel to the Advanced Analytics Dashboard to display dynamic coaching tips.
Visualize metrics like:
Move Frequency Chart: Highlight player tendencies.
Entropy Analysis: Indicate predictability of player moves.
Use visual alerts for high-priority tips (e.g., "AI strategy change detected!").
Optional Enhancements:

Add text-to-speech (TTS) for audible coaching tips.
Allow players to toggle coaching depth (basic vs. advanced tips).
Phase 4: Testing and Optimization

Validate the accuracy and relevance of coaching tips in real gameplay scenarios.
Optimize the pipeline for low-latency performance:
Ensure inference time <100ms for smooth gameplay.
Phase 5: Deployment

Deploy the Coach Feature:
Host the LLM on lightweight cloud servers (e.g., AWS EC2 T2) or integrate locally for on-device inference.
Monitor feature performance and gather user feedback.
3. Advanced Play Mode with Wild Function Cards

Phase 1: Design and Mechanics

Define the Wild Function Cards:
Card Types:
Probability Disruptor: Randomizes AI predictions for one round.
Strategy Shuffler: Forces the AI to switch strategies mid-game.
Blind Spot Card: Makes the AI ignore certain player moves temporarily.
Impact Levels:
Low Impact: Minor disruptions (e.g., randomizing predictions slightly).
Medium Impact: Moderate disruptions (e.g., switching to a suboptimal strategy).
High Impact: Major disruptions (e.g., forcing fully random predictions).
Phase 2: Backend Implementation

Card Logic:

Extend the strategy.py module to implement Wild Card effects:
Example: Probability Disruptor
if active_card == "probability_disruptor":
    ai_prediction = random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
Add cooldown mechanics to limit card usage per game.
AI Adaptation:

Allow the AI to adapt to Wild Cards over time:
Gradually reduce the impact of cards as the game progresses.
Introduce "resistance" mechanics where the AI learns from disruptions.
Phase 3: Frontend Integration

UI for Wild Function Cards:
Add a card selection panel to the gameplay interface.
Display available cards with descriptions and activation buttons.
Visual Effects:
Add animations for card activations (e.g., screen shake, glowing AI predictions).
Phase 4: Testing and Balancing

Test the Wild Card mechanics with players:
Ensure cards add fun and unpredictability without breaking game balance.
Adjust cooldowns, usage limits, and impact levels based on feedback.
Phase 5: Deployment

Release the Advanced Play Mode as an optional feature:
Allow players to enable/disable Wild Cards in the game settings.
Monitor usage and feedback for future enhancements.
4. Integration with Existing Features

Advanced Analytics:
Coach Feature will leverage existing analytics (e.g., entropy calculations, predictability scoring) for deeper insights.
AI Strategies:
The Wild Function Cards will interact dynamically with the existing AI strategies (Random, Markov, LSTM, etc.).
UI/UX:
Both features will integrate seamlessly into the web app, enhancing the overall experience.
