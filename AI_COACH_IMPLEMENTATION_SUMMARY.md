- **Strategic Assessment**: Opportunities, weaknesses, adaptation suggestions

**Lines of Code**: 604 lines
**Integration**: Global instance available via `get_metrics_aggregator()`

### 2. Enhanced Coach System (`enhanced_coach.py`)

**Purpose**: Coordinated coaching system with AI/basic mode toggle and graceful fallback

**Key Features**:
- **Mode Management**: Toggle between 'basic' and 'ai' modes with validation
- **Basic Mode**: Traditional coaching using existing `coach_tips.py`
- **AI Mode**: LangChain-powered coaching with advanced analysis
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic fallback when AI components fail

- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing game systems

**Lines of Code**: 327 lines
**Integration**: Global instance available via `get_enhanced_coach()`

### 3. LangChain Integration Framework (`ai_coach_langchain.py`)

**Purpose**: Advanced LLM-powered coaching using LangChain with optimized prompts

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-Model Support**: Ollama (local), OpenAI API, with graceful fallback to mock LLM
- **Optimized Prompts**: Specialized templates for real-time and comprehensive coaching
- **Structured Output**: JSON parsing for consistent coaching response format
- **Mock LLM**: Testing functionality when LangChain is not installed
- **Memory Management**: Conversation buffer for context-aware coaching
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms

**Lines of Code**: 640 lines
**Integration**: Global instance available via `get_langchain_coach()`

### 4. Flask API Integration

**Purpose**: Web API endpoints for AI coach functionality

**Endpoints Implemented**:
- `GET /ai_coach/status` - System status and feature availability
- `POST /ai_coach/realtime` - Real-time coaching advice
- `POST /ai_coach/comprehensive` - Comprehensive post-game analysis
- `GET /ai_coach/metrics` - Current comprehensive metrics
- `POST /ai_coach/toggle_mode` - Toggle between AI/basic modes
- `GET /ai_coach_demo` - Demo interface page

**Integration Features**:
- Session data integration with existing game state
- Comprehensive error handling with fallback responses
- JSON API responses with structured data
- Graceful degradation when components unavailable

### 5. Demo Interface (`ai_coach_demo.html`)

**Purpose**: Interactive demonstration of AI coach capabilities

**Features**:
- **System Status Display**: Real-time system health and mode indicators
- **Mode Toggle**: Interactive switching between AI and basic modes
- **Live Testing**: Real-time coaching, comprehensive analysis, metrics viewing
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with beautiful styling
- **Output Panel**: Formatted display of API responses and coaching advice
- **Navigation**: Integration with existing game interface

**Lines of Code**: 400+ lines (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
