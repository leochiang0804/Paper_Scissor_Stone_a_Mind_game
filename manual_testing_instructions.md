## Best 25-Move Sequence (Anti_Lstm)
**Expected Win Rate: 35.5%**

Sequence: paper â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ scissor

## Best 50-Move Sequence (Entropy_Maximizer)
**Expected Win Rate: 42.3%**

Sequence: scissor â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ scissor â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ scissor â†’ stone â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ paper â†’ scissor â†’ paper â†’ stone â†’ stone

## How to Test Manually:
1. Set game length to 25 or 50 moves
2. Configure robot: Try different difficulty/strategy/personality combinations
3. Play the sequence exactly as shown above
4. Compare your win rate to the expected rate

## Recommended Test Combinations:
### Most Vulnerable (Easy to beat):
- Random + Not to Lose + Any personality
- Frequency + Balanced + Neutral

### Most Resilient (Hardest to beat):
- Markov + Balanced + Chameleon
- Enhanced + To Win + Berserker

## Tips:
- The sequences work best when played exactly as designed
- Some combinations may still be difficult due to randomness
- Results may vary Â±10% due to random elements in AI
